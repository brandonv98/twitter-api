7. **Homebrew** - Homebrew installs packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files into /usr/local.
   - Learn more - https://brew.sh

* Recommended install with **brew**.
   - past the following into your Terminal  
```
$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

**Install nodeJS & npm with brew** : past the following into your terminal
```
$ brew install node
```
* After install is complete check install using the following in your terminal.  
For **node** - ```node -v``` this will print out a version number like this ```v10.6.0```.  
Now do the same for **npm** as followed ```npm -v``` output will look something like this ```6.2.0```.
